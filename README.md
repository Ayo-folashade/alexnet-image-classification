# Image Classification using AlexNet

This project demonstrates image classification using the AlexNet convolutional neural network architecture. The program takes an input image, preprocesses it, and passes it through the pre-trained AlexNet model to predict the class label based on the ImageNet dataset.

## Description

Image classification is the task of assigning a label or category to an input image based on its content. In this project, we utilize AlexNet, a popular CNN architecture, for image classification. AlexNet has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which consists of millions of labeled images spanning 1,000 different object categories.
